# Project
Durbeen - The Dawn of Programming <br>
Inspired from [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)

# Programming Language
Java accomapnied by [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/)

# Motivation
When we were told to do a project in our OOP (Object Oriented Programming) sessional , we were thinking of doing something different other than the stereotyped Management type projects others were doing . So we got this idea of doing a bangla programming learning platform which was inspired from Scratch .
